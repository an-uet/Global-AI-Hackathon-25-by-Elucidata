# Global-AI-Hackathon-25-by-Elucidata
Overview
The primary objective of this challenge is to develop AI models that can accurately predict the spatial distribution of biological cell types in a tissue slice using routine H&E slides. This will enable deeper insights into tissue biology, bridging the gap between traditional histology and advanced spatial transcriptomics.
